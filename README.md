[Official] Notice: KCT Mainnet Hardfork and Migration to Polygon (PoS)

Hello, this is the Konnect Team.

To facilitate a significant expansion of the KCT ecosystem and revitalize our core business operations, we are officially proceeding with a Mainnet Hardfork and Migration. KCT will transition from the existing Ethereum (ERC-20) network to the Polygon (MATIC) network.

This strategic shift aligns with the official launch of KINC, our core RWA-based distribution funding platform. By migrating to Polygon, we aim to provide a high-performance, global-standard environment for all participants. This hardfork will be executed in coordination with major global and domestic exchanges.

Hardfork and Suspension Schedule The migration will be synchronized based on Singapore Time (SGT), the central hub for our primary exchange partners.
Effective Time: Wednesday, January 7, 2026, at 2:00 PM (SGT, UTC+8)

Participating Exchanges: Gate.io, HTX, GOPAX

Service Impact: Deposits and withdrawals of KCT will be temporarily suspended from the commencement of the hardfork until the new network environment is confirmed as stable.

Strategic Objectives of Migration KINC Platform Integration: Polygon was selected to ensure the seamless deployment of 'KINC'. This transition optimizes debt securitization and ledger issuance, maximizing the utility of our RWA-based funding ecosystem.
Efficiency and Scalability: Migration provides significantly lower gas fees and near-instant transaction finality, removing barriers to entry for global users.

Enhanced Security: This hardfork serves to fortify the ecosystem. It establishes a robust framework to protect user assets and prevent unauthorized outflows, addressing vulnerabilities identified in legacy infrastructure.

Support for External Wallet Holders We are committed to protecting the asset rights of all holders, including those using non-custodial wallets.
Support Period: Active until March 31, 2026.

Eligible Users: Holders with KCT in personal wallets (e.g., MetaMask).

Action Required: A dedicated migration portal will be launched shortly. We encourage personal wallet holders to complete their migration within this window to ensure a seamless transition.

Important Investor Guidelines Automatic Conversion: Assets held within collaborating exchanges (Gate.io, HTX, GOPAX) will be converted automatically. No manual action is required for exchange-based users.
Risk Mitigation: To prevent potential loss of funds, please refrain from any KCT transfers during the migration window until an official "Stability Confirmed" notice is issued.

Our Commitment: The Konnect Team is dedicated to building a real-economy blockchain ecosystem centered on the KINC platform. We appreciate your continued trust as we scale alongside our global partners.
