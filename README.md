[Official] Notice: KCT Mainnet Hardfork and Migration to Polygon (Global)

​Hello, this is the Konnect Team.

​To achieve a significant expansion of the KCT ecosystem and to revitalize our core business operations, we are proceeding with a hardfork and migration of the KCT mainnet from the existing ERC-20 to the Polygon (MATIC) network.
​This decision is strategically aligned with the official launch of our core RWA-based distribution funding platform, 'KINC'. It aims to provide a global-standard network environment for all users. This hardfork will be conducted simultaneously across major global and domestic exchanges, including Gate.io, HTX, and GOPAX, based on Singapore Time (SGT), where many global exchange headquarters are located.

​1. Hardfork and Suspension of Deposits/Withdrawals (Singapore Time)
​Time: Wednesday, January 7, 2026, at 2:00 PM (SGT, UTC+8)
​Collaborating Exchanges: Gate.io, HTX, GOPAX
​Suspension: Deposits and withdrawals of KCT will be temporarily suspended from the start of the hardfork until network stability is confirmed.

​2. Background and Purpose of Mainnet Migration
​Revitalizing Core Business & KINC Platform: The Polygon mainnet was chosen to ensure the successful establishment of 'KINC', our RWA-based funding platform. This will optimize debt securitization and ledger issuance processes, maximizing real-world business utility.
​Maximizing Network Efficiency & Scalability: By migrating to Polygon, we will secure significantly lower gas fees and faster transaction speeds compared to Ethereum, lowering the entry barrier for the global funding ecosystem.
​Enhancing Security & Asset Protection: Through this hardfork, we will secure the health of the ecosystem and establish a robust system to protect assets from unauthorized outflows, such as past hacking incidents.

​3. Migration Support for External Wallet Users
​Support Period: Until March 31, 2026
​Target: Holders who have KCT in personal wallets (e.g., MetaMask), not on exchanges.
​Notice: A dedicated migration page for personal wallet holders will be provided. The Konnect headquarters will ensure a sufficient transition period until the end of March to protect the asset rights of all users.

​4. Important Notes for Investors
​Assets held within the collaborating exchanges (Gate.io, HTX, GOPAX) will be automatically converted, so no individual action is required.
​To prevent loss of funds during the hardfork and migration process, please refrain from any deposits or withdrawals until the official announcement of network stability.
​The Konnect Team is committed to completing a real-economy blockchain ecosystem centered on the KINC platform through this Polygon migration. We will continue to grow as a trusted project through strong collaboration with global exchanges.
